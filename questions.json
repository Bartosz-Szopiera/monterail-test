      "content" : "Male 38 6\"1' White 195 lbs.\n\nHe had an incident almost 20 years ago that cut off circulation to the lower half of his body. It caused peripheral neuropathy mostly in his right leg. After years of physical therapy he regained his muscle strength and had almost no problems except a paralyzed right foot starting about 2\" above the ankle. This foot gives him some trouble but until recently the rest of his leg has been fine. Now he is having severe muscle cramps in his thigh and butt check. We went to the er last week and they have him an iv with steriods, anti-inflammatory, valium, and a mild pain medicine. This helped for a few days but the pain is coming back. They sent him home with a small script of muscle relaxers but they are gone. Is there anything he can do to ease these cramps?",
